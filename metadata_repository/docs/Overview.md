# Overview

The BDSS metadata repository is a map of alternate locations for a specific file.

## Data Model

* Data Source

   A data source contains both the location of files and the method for retrieving them from that
   location. For example, files from [NCBI's SRA Archive](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) can be
   downloaded from ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sra-instant/reads/ using either FTP or
   Aspera. Thus, the metadata repository would contain two data sources: one `NCBI SRA FTP` and
   one `NCBI SRA Aspera`.

* URL Matcher

   In order to identify if a file belongs to a data source known to the repository, each data source
   has one or more URL matchers. These can be configured to match URLs with certain scheme(s)
   and/or hostnames(s) or a more general regular expression.

* Transfer Mechanism

   A source's transfer mechanism is the program that should be used to retrieve files from the
   source. To use the NCBI example again, one data source would be set to use `ftp` as a
   transfer mechanism, the other to use `ascp`. The data source can also have additional options
   that are passed to the transfer mechanism. These are interpreted by the client and used to
   build the command that will be used to invoke the mechanism. For example, the `ftp` mechanism
   might provide a username option so that a data source could specify a username that is used
   for anonymous access to its server.

* URL Transform

   A URL transform defines how files from one data source are mapped to another data source. A
   basic example would be an FTP mirror site where files are served from the exact same path
   with the same method for retrieving them. In this case, the transform would simply replace
   the hostname in the URL for file at the first data source with the hostname of the mirror
   site to get a URL for the same file at the second data source.

   A transform has a source and target data source and maps URLs from the source to the target.
   Transforms should always link a slower source to a faster target.

* Test File

   The URL matchers can determine data sources given a URL, but it can also be useful to go the
   other way. The list of test files are known files at a specific data source. These can be
   used for things like testing transfer speeds from the data source. Also, they provide some
   validation of the data source's URL matcher configuration, as each test file URL is checked
   against the data source's matchers when it is added.

## Workflow

   See the [workflow diagram](/metadata_repository/docs/user/workflow.svg) for a visual explanation.

   When a client requests alternate sources for a file, it sends the file URL. The metadata
   repository identifies which (if any) known data sources match the URL using the data sources'
   URL matchers.

   For each source that does match, the file URL is run through each URL transform configured for
   the source. The transform output provides an alternate URL for the file and the transform's
   target data source provides information about the transfer mechanism that should be used to
   retrieve the file from the alternate URL.
