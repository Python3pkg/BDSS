# Manage User Permissions

Administrators can grant/revoke administrator rights to/from other users. To do this:

1. Click your name at the top right and click "Registered Users" in the dropdown menu. You must
   be logged in as an administrator in order to see this link.

2. A list of all users registered with the metadata repository will be shown. If a user has
   administrator rights, then "Administrator" will be displayed below their email address.

3. Click a user's name in the list of users. The following page will have a link "Grant Admin
   Permissions" or "Revoke Admin Permissions" depending on the user's current administrator
   status. Click that link to toggle their permissions. You will be prompted to confirm your
   choice.
