1. From the home screen, click "Add New Data Source". You must have administrator rights in order
   to see this link.

2. Enter a label for the new data source and an optional description.

3. Select the transfer mechanism used to retrieve files from this source and configure available options.
   See the documentation for individual transfer mechanisms for more information.
