# Add a URL Matcher

URL matchers are what link URLs of data files to known data sources. Without at least
one URL matcher, the metadata repository cannot do anything with a source. To add a
URL matcher to a source.

1. Navigate to the data source's information page by either:

   * Selecting the source from the list of all sources.
   * [Searching for the source by name](/metadata_repository/docs/user/search_data_sources.md)
     and selecting it from the results.

2. Click "Add URL Matcher". You must be logged in as an administrator in order to see this link.

3. Select the matcher type and configure available options. A description of each matcher type
   and option should be provided on the page.

4. After adding a matcher, you can edit or delete it later by navigating to the data source's
   information page and clicking on the matcher in the list of matchers. You will be redirected
   to a page with edit and delete links.
