# Add a URL Transform

URL transforms map file URLs from one data source to another. To add a URL transform:

1. Select a source to transform from. Navigate to the data source's information page by either:

   * Selecting the source from the list of all sources.
   * [Searching for the source by name](/metadata_repository/docs/user/search_data_sources.md)
     and selecting it from the results.

2. Click "Add URL Transform". You must be logged in as an administrator in order to see this link.

3. Select a target data source. URLs matching the original source will be transformed to URLs
   matching this source.

3. Enter an optional description.

4. Select the transform type and configure available options. A description of each transform type
   and option should be provided on the page. Keep in mind that the output of the transform must
   match the target data source's URL matcher configuration.

5. After adding a transform, you can edit or delete it later by navigating to the data source's
   information page and clicking on the transform in the list of transforms. You will be redirected
   to a page with edit and delete links.
