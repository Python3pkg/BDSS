# Search Data Sources

Instead of going through the full list of all data sources in the repository, you can also
search for specific data sources by name.

1. From the home screen, click "Search Data Sources".

2. Enter a search query and submit the form.

3. The output will list all data sources containing your query in the name. The search is
   case insensitive.
